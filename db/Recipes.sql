'1. Bring pot of water to a boil. Sauce will be very salty, so no need to salt the pasta water. Add spaghetti.
2. While spaghetti cooks, crush and mince garlic. 
3. Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook around 2 minutes. Garlic should be fragrant but not brown.
4. Add a tablespoon of oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons of fish sauce to the pan and mix.
5. As soon as noodles are done, drain, reserving some pasta water, and add to pan. Toss until noodles are throughly coated. Add small amounts of pasta water until the sauce is creamy and not overly greasy-looking.
6. Optionally top with grated parmesan or pecorino, and scallions. Serve.');

'1. Preheat oven to 450F or 230C.
2. Peel potatoes and cut into medium size chunks, about 1.5 inches in length. If the pieces are too small, they can fall apart in later stages, so be careful.
3. Bring 2 liters of water to boil in a pot. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (less if using fine salt) and the baking soda.
4. Add potatoes to the water, return to a boil, then simmer until a butterknife easily enters the pieces, around 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
5. While potatoes boil, crush and mince the garlic. Heat 5 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan, and add garlic.
6. Cook while stirring until garlic is just beginning to turn golden.
7. Strain oil, reserving garlic bits for later.
8. When potatoes are ready, drain gently (the potato chunks will be weak by this point), then return potatoes to the empty pot and let dry for 30 seconds.
9. Toss potatoes gently in infused oil. Also add salt and pepper to taste while tossing. The goal is to create a layer of mashed-potato-like paste on the outside of the pieces, as this will become a crispy exterior during baking.
10. Move potatoes to a baking sheet and spread out evenly.
11. Bake potatoes for 20 minutes without moving them. Then, flip and turn potatoes and return to oven. Repeat every 15-20 minutes until potatoes are the desired darkness (typically 45 minutes to 1 hour total).
12. Remove potatoes from oven. Toss with reserved garlic, and add more salt or pepper if desired. Serve.');

'1. Finely dice onion and long green pepper.
2. Chop tomatoes. Alternatively, grate tomatoes using large side of a box grater.
3. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over low heat. Once barely warm, add paprika, onion, and long green pepper. Season generously with salt and pepper.
4. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are very soft (around 8 minutes).
5. Add tomatoes and continue to cook & stir until color deepens.
6. Crack in eggs. Gently break the yolks and spread the eggs through the mixture slowly. This will create streaks of egg throughout the dish. Beating the eggs completely will create more of a scrambled egg texture, which usually is not wanted for this dish.
7. Season again with salt and pepper.
8. Continue to slowly cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are mostly set.
9. Remove from heat. Eggs will continue to set from residual heat.
10. Optionally top with cheese. Serve.');
